    "# Top 10 Most Influential Women in Pop Culture\n",
    "\n",
    "I was thinking a lot about the topic of my first blog post, as I really wanted it to be something special, which represents me well and shows a snippet of my skillset at the same time. Having the International Women's Day just around the corner, I thought running an analysis on what and who inspires women the most would be really exciting. I could not help involving my other field of interest: I am going to investigate pop culture's impact through movies and TV shows."

    "As I found the open governmental (data source)[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html] of the babies' names born in between 1880 and 2017, I though what could be a better marker of impact that naming your own child after one of your heroes.\n",

    "Given the birth data, I had to find a set of names of influential characters as candidates. Although IMBb doesn't provide an open API, I found (TMBd)[https://www.themoviedb.org/] as an alternative for interative search. It provides a daily updated \"most poopular\" list of movies and TV shows, but it contains almost exclusively recent titles, which doesn't help our analysis of impact. On the other hand it also provides a list of top rated movies, critically successful titles usually have larger pop culture relevancy.\n",
